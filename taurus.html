  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4">♉ Taurus</h1>
  <p class="mt-2">You are grounded, patient, and loyal — the true rock among the zodiac signs. Stability and comfort are your life goals, and you don’t rush into anything without being sure.

Career: You’re a natural in finance, design, architecture, and anything that allows for patience and precision. You work hard, and you love seeing tangible results.

Behavior: Calm and composed — until someone moves your favorite mug or questions your routine. You’re not stubborn, just... committed (okay, fine, you're stubborn).

Future: Slow and steady truly wins your race. You’ll build a secure, comfortable life brick by brick, and you’ll protect it with your life.

Love Life: You’re deeply romantic and committed once you choose someone — but that person better love cuddles, good food, and not touching the thermostat.
