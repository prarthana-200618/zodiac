  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4">♑ Capricorn</h1>
  <p class="mt-2">Capricorns are disciplined, responsible, and ambitious. They are masters of self-control and leadership.
  You’re the definition of discipline. Ambitious, wise beyond your years, and probably born with a 5-year plan.

Career: CEO, finance, engineering, law — anywhere structure and results matter. You work hard, climb faster, and rarely brag.

Behavior: Serious but secretly funny, responsible but low-key chaotic. You're the friend who brings a budget spreadsheet to a party.

Future: Stability and success are guaranteed — if you learn to loosen up and enjoy the process. All work and no play makes Cap a stressed icon.

Love Life: You're loyal and dependable, but you take time to open up. You love practically, deeply, and with a calendar of shared goals.

<bold> You probably started retirement planning at 16. Breathe, Capricorn — not every emotion needs to be scheduled.</bold></p>
