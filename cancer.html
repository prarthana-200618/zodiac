  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4">♋ Cancer</h1>
  <p class="mt-2">Soft on the outside, softer on the inside — you’re an emotional powerhouse who feels everything deeply. You’re intuitive, protective, and seriously sentimental.

Career: Nursing, counseling, education, home decor — anything where your nurturing nature can shine. You’re the ultimate caretaker.

Behavior: Quietly observant, you absorb the room’s energy before deciding whether to stay or run. You love hard, but you’re also hard to get to know.

Future: Emotional growth will be your superpower. As you learn to trust more, you’ll build something that lasts — both in love and in career.

Love Life: You love love. Deeply, honestly, and intensely. Just don’t expect you to move on easily — you’re emotionally Velcro.
