  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4">♍ Virgo</h1>
  <p class="mt-2">Virgos are analytical, detail-oriented, and practical. They seek perfection and are always ready to help others.
  You're precise, analytical, and the human version of a checklist. Order is your love language, and chaos gives you anxiety rashes.

Career: You’re excellent in research, healthcare, tech, and anything that needs perfection. Details are your domain — and typos are personal enemies.

Behavior: Calm, collected, and super observant. You’ll notice a missing comma in someone’s soul before they even say hello.

Future: Your practical nature ensures a secure and stable life, but only if you learn to go with the flow occasionally and stop trying to spreadsheet your emotions.

Love Life: You love through acts of service and being a reliable partner. You’re a ride-or-die — just don’t expect grand romantic poems. Your love letter is probably a bullet-point list.

<bold> You edited this message in your head, didn’t you? Admit it, Virgo — you’d proofread a breakup text before crying about it.</bold></p>
