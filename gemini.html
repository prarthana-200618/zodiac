  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4">♊ Gemini</h1>
  <p class="mt-2">You are a curious soul with a brain that never hits pause. One minute you’re into philosophy, the next you’re rearranging your closet by color and genre of emotion.

Career: You shine in communication-heavy roles — media, sales, teaching, or anything that lets you talk, think, and switch gears often. Sitting still is a crime in your world.

Behavior: Adaptable and witty, you're the life of every party and the ghost of every group chat. You multitask like it’s a sport.

Future: It’s bright — assuming you can finish what you start. Your ideas are golden, but your attention span? Hmm...

Love Life: Flirty and fun, you’re charming as hell. Commitment? Well... depends on how interesting they are next week.

<bold>You change your mind more than people change their Netflix passwords. Calm down, Gemini — not everything needs a plot twist.
