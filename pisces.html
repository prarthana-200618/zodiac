  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4">♓ Pisces</h1>
  <p class="mt-2">Pisces are empathetic, artistic, and dreamy. They are deeply intuitive and connected to their emotions.
  You are dreamy, intuitive, and emotionally cosmic. Art and empathy are your superpowers, and reality is just... optional.

Career: Art, music, healing professions, or spiritual work. You follow inspiration, not instruction manuals.

Behavior: You feel deeply — yours, theirs, the planet’s. You give great advice but often forget to take your own.

Future: You’ll drift into your dreams and probably turn one into a bestseller or indie film. Just stay grounded (sometimes).

Love Life: Romantically idealistic, you give your all — sometimes too much. Boundaries? We’re working on it.

<bold>You cried because a squirrel looked sad. It’s okay, Pisces — we love you, but maybe take a break from the emotional WiFi.</bold></p>
