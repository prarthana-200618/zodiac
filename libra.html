  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4">♎ Libra</h1>
  <p class="mt-2">Libras are fair, diplomatic, and social. They value harmony, beauty, and strong relationships.
  You're graceful, charming, and allergic to conflict. If diplomacy were a sport, you’d have more gold medals than Michael Phelps.

Career: Law, fashion, counseling, or design — anywhere beauty and balance matter. You work best in partnerships, whether romantic or business.

Behavior: You weigh everything, literally. Choosing a sandwich feels like writing a peace treaty. But your kindness makes people feel seen.

Future: Smooth sailing — if you can stop being so indecisive. Your talent lies in connecting people and making peace, just remember to choose your own side too.

Love Life: You’re all about romance, harmony, and emotional balance. You fall in love with love, and you hate being alone more than you hate confrontation.

<bold> You take longer to choose a Netflix show than it took to end the Cold War. Pick a side, Libra — even if it’s just chocolate vs. vanilla.</bold></p>
