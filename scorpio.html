  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4">♏ Scorpio</h1>
  <p class="mt-2">Scorpios are passionate, determined, and mysterious. They have strong intuition and emotional depth.
  You are intensity incarnate. Mysterious, magnetic, and emotional — people either fear you, love you, or both.

Career: Psychology, investigation, surgery, or anything that digs deep. You’re not afraid of the dark, because you probably live there part-time.

Behavior: Loyal to the bone, but trust doesn’t come easy. Cross you once, and they’ll never find the body. (Kidding. Probably.)

Future: You're destined for power and transformation. Your rebirths are legendary — just don’t burn every bridge in the process.

Love Life: Obsessive, passionate, and private. You love like it’s a sacred ritual... or a true crime podcast.

<bold> You’ve imagined your enemy’s downfall in 4K. Relax, Scorpio — not everyone who unfollows you is plotting against you.</bold></p>
