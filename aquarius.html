  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4">♒ Aquarius</h1>
  <p class="mt-2">Aquarians are innovative, independent, and humanitarian. They think outside the box and value individuality.
  You're the cosmic oddball — intelligent, innovative, and always 10 thoughts ahead of everyone else. Normal is not in your vocabulary.

Career: Tech, science, activism, or anything involving big change. You’re a visionary, not a follower.

Behavior: You crave connection but on your terms. Emotionally detached? Maybe. Deeply caring underneath? Absolutely.

Future: Bound to be unique — whether that means starting a revolution or building a robot that does your chores.

Love Life: You love minds, not just hearts. You’re attracted to intelligence, creativity, and people who respect your space.

<bold> You ghosted your emotions like a pro. Admit it, Aquarius — you’d rather marry a WiFi signal than a clingy human.
