  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4">♌ Leo</h1>
  <p class="mt-2">Leos are confident, charismatic, and creative. Natural performers, they love to be in the spotlight.
  You’re the main event. Charismatic, bold, and full of fire — you don’t just enter a room, you command it like a stage.

Career: Acting, leadership, fashion, PR — anywhere you can shine. You need appreciation like plants need sunlight.

Behavior: Confident and loyal, but touch your pride and it’s game over. You're generous, but also slightly addicted to applause.

Future: Fame? Fortune? Recognition? All within reach — especially if you remember to let others talk once in a while.

Love Life: Grand gestures, dramatic declarations, and constant reassurance. You love loudly, and you want to be loved even louder.

<bold> You’d make a great mirror — since you’re always reflecting on how amazing you are. Relax, Leo — the sun rises without your permission.</bold></p>
