  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4">♐ Sagittarius</h1>
  <p class="mt-2">Sagittarius individuals are adventurous, optimistic, and philosophical. They love travel and freedom.
  Freedom is your fuel. You’re adventurous, optimistic, and allergic to anything that smells like routine.

Career: Travel, teaching, journalism, or startups — anything with a mission and movement. Sitting still isn’t an option.

Behavior: Honest to a fault, always learning, and sometimes unintentionally blunt. You're like a walking TED Talk with zero filter.

Future: Wild and unpredictable, but full of growth and experience. You’ll probably change careers (and hairstyles) at least 7 times.

Love Life: You need a partner in adventure — not someone who’ll chain you down. Romance is fun, as long as it doesn’t feel like homework.

<bold>You booked a one-way flight to “finding yourself” and never came back. Chill, Sag — not everything is a gap year.
